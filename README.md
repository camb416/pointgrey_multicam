## Point Grey Multicam Example

An example file to build upon when using dual USB Firefly MV cameras in a travelling computer vision installation.

## Motivation

Replacement hardware is important, and devices must iterate the same even after the pieces are deinstalled and reassembled. Camera IDs will need to be available to the installer, who can then check their configuration in an external file.
